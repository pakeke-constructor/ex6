# Agent specialization ideas:

agent that is specialized in crafting/refining prompts

agent that specializes write tests

agent that can programmatically interact with world for testing.
eg. Spoof a user. Set up a test-scenario. Check output.


agent specialized in rendering. (eg love.graphics)
agent specialized in love2d docs, pulls in proper functions.


agent specialized in *OLD CODEBASES.* pulls over old code from catx11, or lootplot.

agent specialized in exploring codebase.

agent specialized in discovering what the user wants.
^^ use this agent to craft prompts



agent specialized in removing unneccessary functions/abstractions/indirections. Eg function is defined (but only called once.)


agent specialized in cleaning if-blocks (push ifs upwards), (and pushing ifs closer to data)

agent specialized in removing unneccessary indirection in data-structures. eg, creating a new table-type, only to destroy/convert it immediately afterwards.
