# Project description:

## ex6: A tool for nitty-gritty context engineering.
This project, `ex6`, serves as a thin, simple alternative to claude-code.

## Project goals:
- Serves as a thin, simple layer; no leaky/overreaching abstractions.
- No hidden/implict context. User can see entire ctx window, and has FULL control.
- High degree of customization/control via plugins. (python files)
- Lives in terminal.
- Written as a self-contained python file.


# AGENT GOALS:
- You are working with a talented engineer, if you need guidance or clarifications, ask.
- In all interactions, be extremely concise.
- When writing code, write the simplest code possible. Aggressively avoid complexity.
